/**
 * Deterministic subplan cluster-coverage floor — the structural backstop between

 * what the slice map PROMISED, before the root `plan` merge fans them in:
 *   • cluster-count conservation — the PRE-FILTER cluster count
 *     (`clusterSliceDag(sliceRecords(latest slices)).length`) must equal the
 *     number of distinct `_cluster-<k>` ordinals the fanout emitted. A re-dispatch
 *     that re-clobbered an ordinal (the pre-fix clobber bug — two clusters
 *     sharing `<k>`, or a tokenless basename) collapses the distinct count,
 *     surfacing as a missing cluster here.
 *   • token conformance — every dispatched sub-plan basename MUST carry a
 *     `_cluster-<k>` token; a tokenless name means `synthesize` dropped the
 *     `--cluster <k>` flag and the merge can't attribute it to a cluster.
 *   • duplicate/clobbered ordinal — two dispatched sub-plans sharing the same
 *     `<k>` (a clobber, not a legitimate re-emit: `placeFanoutOutput` overwrites
 *     each unit's own index in the channel slot, so within one round every unit
 *     index is a distinct artifact — a shared `<k>` is a real collision, the
 *     lost-cluster bug itself).
 *   • sources-coverage — every slice's design must appear in SOME sub-plan's
 *     `sources:` (the fanout threads each `--designs <path>` and `synthesize`
 *     echoes them into `sources:`). Designs follow the `_slice-<N>` convention, so
 *     the covered slice set is read off `sources:` and reconciled against the full
 *     slice map; a slice whose design no sub-plan lists is a slice the merge would
 *     silently drop. A sub-plan whose frontmatter does not PARSE gets its own
 *     re-dispatchable finding naming the FILE (never a `FAIL_SCRIPT_THREW` halt —
 *     the same stray-colon class `artifact-collector` degrades on), and the
 *     per-slice reconciliation defers until every sub-plan parses, so a parse
 *     failure is never mis-blamed on the slices it happened to cover.
 * Preflight: a slice with NO design on the `designs` channel halts LOUD before
 * any reconciliation — the fanout drops (or under-feeds) its cluster pre-dispatch
 * (`if (!designs.length) return undefined`), so re-dispatching `subplan` re-drops
 * it every round until the re-entry budgets exhaust (the `maxBackwardJumps`
 * cap, default 3, or the absolute `maxLaps` ceiling, default 8 — both fresh
 * per invocation) with a diagnostic naming the
 * refused re-entry instead of the cause. The missing design is upstream
 * (`slice-design`/`design-review`) and unreachable from this loop's backward
 * edge; halting here names the actual defect and spends no jump budget.
 * Emits `severity: pass ? "none" : "high"` (load-bearing — the route routes via
 * `allDimensionsPass`/`subplanGatePasses`, whose severity floor silently passes a
 * `pass:false` verdict rated `low`/`none`; a lost cluster MUST rate `high` or it
 * ships). Deliberately NOT the `match("verdict", …)` STOP idiom
 * `implementScopeCheck` uses — a lost cluster IS repairable by re-dispatch, so the
 * floor routes the backward edge to `subplan`, bounded by `maxBackwardJumps`
 * (default 3) under the absolute `maxLaps` ceiling (default 8; both budgets
 * fresh per invocation).
 * Deterministic ⇒ idempotent across re-dispatch rounds: the verdict basename is
