/**
 * The built-in `meta` unit graph — the A/B challenger to `build`.
 *
 *   meta   research → acceptance → plan → implement → commit
 *
 * research is the one mandatory unit; the rest are optional per graph.
 *
 * Same skills as build/ship (research, acceptance, quick-plan, implement), so
 * an A/B run measures the SHAPE — per-unit loops with code-first graders and
 * scoped returns vs build's sliced, panel-gated stage graph — not the prompts.
