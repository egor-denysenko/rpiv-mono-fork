// Splice per-phase elaboration docs back into a synthesized plan, deterministically.
//
// Usage: node stitch-elaborations.mjs <plan-path>
//   <plan-path> — a plan under .rpiv/artifacts/plans/ (relative paths resolve
//                 against the git root, then cwd).
//
// The fan-in barrier of the elaborate fanout. Each `## Phase N:` section in the
// plan is replaced, one-for-one, by the matching elaboration doc's body. This is
// a pure swap by phase number — NOT a reconcile: `synthesize` already resolved
// the cross-phase seams; this only injects the code each `elaborate` lane wrote.
//
// Elaboration docs live in the sibling bucket .rpiv/artifacts/elaborations/,
// named `<plan-basename-without-ext>__phase-<N>.md` (the `elaborate` skill's
// output contract). Each carries a single `## Phase <N>: <title>` section with
// implement-ready code; its frontmatter is stripped before splicing.
//
// Preserved verbatim: the plan's frontmatter (incl. `phase_count`) and the
// preamble before the first phase (`## Synthesis Notes`, etc.). The trailing
// `## Whole-Plan Verification` section is preserved as well: an authored block
// is re-appended verbatim after the last phase (the swap of an elaborated last
// phase would otherwise drop it, heading to EOF); with no authored block but a
// Synthesis-Notes reference to one, a block is derived from the per-phase
// `Automated Verification:` items — never invented otherwise. Phase boundaries
// are detected fence-aware (a `## ` inside a Find/Replace code block is NOT a
// boundary) and each phase owns everything up to the next `## Phase N:` heading,
// so the swap is idempotent — re-stitching can't accumulate duplicate per-phase
// trailers (Success Criteria / Notes / Deferred). An elaboration is refused
// when a fence it opens never closes (the leak would swallow the next phase's
// heading) or when it carries other than one out-of-fence `## Phase N:`
// heading, and the stitched body is refused before writing if its heading
// count drifted, so the downstream `phase_count == '## Phase N:' headings`
// derive-check stays valid.
//
// Always exits 0 on a normal run (a plan phase with no elaboration is left as-is
// and reported — partial runs are allowed). Exits 1 on a refused elaboration or a wiring/path error:
// missing argument, missing plan, or zero elaboration docs found.
